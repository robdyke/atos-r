## What is ATOS-R?

A Totally Open Source R container for NHSland.

## Why ATOS-R

[The Register reports](https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/29/atos_nhs_foss_charges/) that NHS England pays between £6,000 and £8,000 to package up open source software. According to documents seen by The Register, requests for FOSS packages are fulfilled by outsourcer Atos, as part of its £136m agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care signed in June 2019.

> Analysts within NHS England who work on strategic planning of one of the world's largest public health systems, as well as assisting with the COVID-19 response, have requested common, freely available open-source packages such as R, the statistical language, and Python, the general-purpose language.
>
> Management teams said these would cost between £6,000 and £8,000 for Atos to "package" for the public-sector organisation. The exact figures have not been disclosed to protect the source of the information.
>
> One worker at NHS England told The Register that there were also fees for updating FOSS software on NHS systems, which meant management turned down requests, creating security risks.
