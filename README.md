# Why ATOS-R

[The Register reports](https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/29/atos_nhs_foss_charges/) that NHS England pays between ¬£6,000 and ¬£8,000 for ATOS to package up open source software.

> Analysts within NHS England who work on strategic planning of one of the world's largest public health systems, as well as assisting with the COVID-19 response, have requested common, freely available open-source packages such as R, the statistical language, and Python, the general-purpose language.
>
> One worker at NHS England told The Register that there were also fees for updating FOSS software on NHS systems, which meant management turned down requests, creating security risks.
